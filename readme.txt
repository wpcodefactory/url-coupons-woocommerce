Are you tired of customers abandoning carts because they forgot to apply a discount code? Our plugin solves this problem by enabling you to create special URLs that automatically apply coupons at checkout.

No more frustration for your customers, and no more lost sales for you. With just a click, shoppers can enjoy their discounts hassle-free, leading to increased conversions and happier customers.

## 🚀 Main Features: FREE Version##

### 🚀 Create Custom URLs to Apply Coupons ###

No more manual entry for coupons, the plugin allows you to easily generate unique URLs that automatically apply discount coupons when visited.

You can share these coupon-ready links in emails, social media, or directly on your website (like a banner), providing a seamless and hassle-free discount experience for your customers.

Perfect for promotions, marketing campaigns, and increasing conversion rates.

### 🚀 Customize URL Key for Coupon Application ###

Define custom URL keys to allow customers to apply standard shop coupons directly through a URL. For example, use a link like this to apply the discount  and enhance user experience (and reflect your marketing strategy branding)
`
http://example.com/?apply_coupon=couponcode
`

### 🚀 Customize Notice Messages for Coupons ###

Whenever a coupon is applied, or was already applied, or doesn't exist, the plugin allows you to customize the notice message that appears to users to keep them informed about what just happened.

### 🚀 Supports Logged & Non-Logged In Users ###

Ensure coupon URLs function seamlessly for both logged-in and guest users by forcing a session start when a URL with the coupon key is accessed, enabling URL coupons for non-logged-in users.

And for sites with caching issues, you can enable early and universal session start to guarantee URL coupon activation for guest users.

### 🚀 Hide Coupon Field on Cart & Checkout ###

Control showing/hiding of the standard coupon input fields on your store, the plugin allows you to choose to hide the coupon input field on the cart page and/or checkout page.

Additionally, you have the option to hide the field either always or only when a coupon is applied via URL.

### 🚀 Advanced Options ###

* Advanced compatibility with WP Rocket caching plugin
* Javascript reload: Reload the page via javascript when the coupon is detected from the URL
* Control main hook: Select the main hook used to detect and handle the coupon via URL, whether it was WP Loaded or Init
* Control data storage type: Select the way the data from the plugin will be stored/retrieved (session or cookie)
* Fire extra cookie on coupon activation
